###Laredo Bridge Cams

####Background

So in this time of the year, there's a lot of activity on the U.S. border (Mexican citizens going to the US for christmas shopping and US citizens going to Mexico to visit family) and on the City of Laredo website there's a section where you can see pictures of each side of the border, so you can have an idea of how many cars are lined up.

The thing is, the site is not very mobile-friendly, and since I've been learning to use [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) this week, I decided to make a super simple app in Ember to show the borders' pictures, taking advantage of Bootstrap's mobile-first methodology. 

Since design is not my strong point, the app's design sucks, but it serves it's purpose. If anyone is interested in improving the design, you're more than welcome to send me a pull-request.
